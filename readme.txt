Ultimate Gutenberg Block is a plugin for Gutenberg editor which adds many useful blocks to Gutenberg Editor.


== Description ==
Looking for the map in Gutenberg? End up your search here. We are introducing the exclusive map block to generate ready-to-use maps just by typing the address. Generate the maps at front-end by simply follow these three steps - Install the plugin, activate it, add it to the content and enjoy the Gutenberg-ing.

This plugin requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg plugin</a>, until Gutenberg gets merged into core.

= Plugin Features =

Works as any other Gutenberg block with the following settings:
* Set Your Address
* Map-height adjustment
* Zoom
* API key – once saved in one block it’s used in all others

= What's New =

We are working on new blocks and add many more useful blocks in coming future and enhance the plugin to New Level.
